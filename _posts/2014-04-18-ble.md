BlueTooth Low Energy
=====
This blog is used to conclude the BLE main knowleadge point in my working life.

##BLE PHY 

* LE data channel number is possible 37, index at 0~36

* advertisign channel 3, index at 37,38, 39

* frequency point: 2402~2480MHz  bandwidth=2MHz

**broadcast channel**

* advertiser

  	transimit advertising packet

* scanner

   	receiving advertising packet but don't intension to establish connection

* initiator
	
	listen advertising packet and intend to initialize an link

##Physical link

* LE active physical link 
* LE advertising physical link 

##Logic transport
**LE ACL**

* Identified by the access channel number

**LE ADVB**

* Identified by the advertiserâ€™s Bluetooth device address
* No acknowledgement and unreliable

##Logic link

**Control Logical Link (LE-C)**
	
* Used to carry LE LL signaling between devices in the piconet.

**User Asynchronous Logical Link (LE-U)**
	
* Used to carry all asynchronous and frame user data.

**Advertising Broadcast Control Logical Link (ADVB-C)**

**Advertising Broadcast User Data Logical Link (ADVB-U)**
