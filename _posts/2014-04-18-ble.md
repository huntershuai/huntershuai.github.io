BlueTooth Low Energy
=====
This blog is used to conclude the BLE main knowleadge point in my working life.


## Bluetooth Core System Architecture

<img src="/images/ble/bt_core_frame.jpg" width="500"> </img>

## BLE PHY 

* BLE channel numbter:37, index at 0~36

* BLE broadcast channel:3, index at 37,38, 39

* BLE channel frequency range：2402~2480MHz
* BLE channel bandwidth： 2MHz

BLE 网络中主（Master）和Slave（从）设备的数据基本交互方式如下：

<img src=" /images/ble/phy_channel.jpg" width="500"></img>


### Broadcast channel

During broadcast, including 3 roles:

* advertiser

  	transimit advertising packet

* scanner

   	receiving advertising packet but don't intension to establish connection

* initiator

    listen advertising packet and intend to initialize an link

### Physical link

* LE active physical link 
* LE advertising physical link 


## Logic transport

### BLE Roles & message exchange procedure

### Device Address

- BD_ADDR(48bit: lower-24bit, upper-8bit)

- AM_ADDR(3bit): master allocte for slave when slave at the state of active to identify different slave device.

- PM_ADDR(8bit): when device transit state from active to park, allocated with this kind of address.

- AR_ADDR: device at the state of park use this address to request to master to transit the state to active , and the same address can be used by more than one device;

## Link layer


## Security Manager

### SMP procedure analysis

Defines the protocol and behavior to manage pairing, authentication and encryption between LE devices.

- Authentication and key management
- AES-128
- Secure link


Pair phase including 4 phases：

- Phase 1: Pairing Feature Exchange
- Phase 2 (LE legacy pairing): Short Term Key (STK) Generation
- Phase 2 (LE Secure Connections):  Long Term Key (LTK) Generation (optional)
- Phase 3: Transport Specific Key Distribution

![smp layer position](http://oioif6720.bkt.clouddn.com/pair_process.png)
 

In phase 1, authenticatioin requirement and IO capability will be exchanged, and the following method will be determined and used in Phase2:

- Just Works
- Numeric Comparison (Only  for LE Secure Connections)
- Passkey Entry
- Out Of Band (OOB)

and here, list the IO capability defined in spec, as below:

![smp layer position](http://oioif6720.bkt.clouddn.com/io_capability.png)


And **OOB Authentication Data** is descriped as below:

>An out of band mechanism may be used to communicate information which is used during the pairing process. The information shall be **a sequence of Advertising Data structures**

>In LE legacy pairing, the out of band method is used if both the devices have the other device's out of band authentication data available. In LE Secure Connections pairing, the out of band method is used if at least one device has the peer device's out of band authentication data available.

>the  Out of Band method can be more secure than using the Passkey Entry or Just Works methods.



##	L2CAP analysis

![smp layer position](http://oioif6720.bkt.clouddn.com/l2cap_arch.png)

L2CAP function：

- Protocol/channel multiplexing

- Segmentation and reassembly

- Flow control per L2CAP channel:A window based flow control scheme is provided

- Error control and retransmissions

- Support for Streaming: AUDIO (BR/EDR),not BLE

- Fragmentation and  Recombination(seem common function with "segmentation")

- Quality of Service


### BLE packet format

<img src=" /images/ble/ble_packet.png" width="500"></img>


HCI Header: Handle (2Bytes) + Length (2Bytes)

L2CAP Header: PDU Length (2 Bytes) + CID(2Bytes)

ATT Data: Opcode (1Byte) + Data(variable)

### Packet type

Four logical transports with distinct packet types are defined：

* SCO logical transport

* eSCO logical transport

* ACL logical transport

* CSB logical transport.

To indicate the different packets on a logical transport, the 4-bit TYPE code is used，The packet types are divided into four segments：

![smp layer position](http://oioif6720.bkt.clouddn.com/packet_type.png)

 - The first segment is reserved for control packets. All control packets occupy a single time slot. 
 - The sec- ond segment is reserved for packets occupying a single time slot. 
 - The third seg- ment is reserved for packets occupying three time slots.
 - The fourth segment is reserved for packets occupying five time slots. The slot occupancy is reflected in the segmentation and can directly be derived from the type code. Table 6.2 on page 125 summarizes the packets defined for the SCO, eSCO, ACL, and CSB logical transport types.


## GATT & ATT

### GATT hierarchy：

### GATT procedure
Here， List whole GATT procedure as belows:
