作者: Peter Thiel / Blake Masters 


断断续续花了一个月读完了这本书，读之前不是奔着作者投资思想家，paypal元老的名声，而是这本书最近在我眼前的出镜率太高了，想拿来一探究竟，到底写的啥玩意，这才知道了作者的大名。

书的内容无外乎创业的指导，与其他创业精神导师并无大异，换了种说法而已，但是其中的一些概念以及分析方法是在其他类似书中没有见到的，在这里进行总结与记录。

## preface

this book stems from a course about startups that i taught at stanford in 2012...

## party like it's 1999

lessons from dot-com crash:

- make incremental advances
- stay lean and flexible
	
	try things out,'iterate', and treat entrepreneurship as anostic(不可知论者) experimentation

- improve on the competition

	the only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing custumer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors
	
- focus on product, not sales

priciples:

- better to risk boldness than triviality
- a bad plan is better than no plan
- competitive markets detroy profit
- sales matters just as much as product

## all happy company are different

> if the tendency of monoply business were to hold back progress , they would be dangerous and we'd be right to oppose them, but the history of progress is a history of progress is a history of better monopoly business replacing incumbents

 >  every monoply is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristic: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
